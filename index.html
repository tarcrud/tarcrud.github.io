    <p>Night of party is a role play game based on communication and strategy. Players were assigned different roles and
      they should act by their alignment. Through reasoning and exchanging issues to guess others’ role. As days pass
      more and more confirmed role will shows and the truth will reveal.</p>
    <p>The idea of Night Of Party originates from Town of Salem, Mafia and DnD, the style of UI were taken from my last
      game AnotherPlanet. The game has different modes which contain various roles of unique abilities and features.
      Also it has single(offline) mode and multiple(online) mode.</p>
